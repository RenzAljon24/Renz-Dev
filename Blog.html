    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, World!</h1>
    <p class="mt-4">Welcome to my website! I'm a first-year IT student who is currently studying the fundamentals of web development. This blog kicks off my journey as a student, where I'll share experiences, insights, and some cool programming stuff.</p>
  </header>

  <section id="who-am-i" class="container mx-auto my-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who am I?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">My name is Renz Aljon Cruz, and I come from Pangasinan, Philippines, where I completed my elementary and high school education. For a long time, I have dreamed of studying political science and becoming a lawyer, but that dream was shattered when I stumbled upon a YouTube video about the BSIT course. It explained how technology is transforming the world and how it works, and it ignited my curiosity. I wondered:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li>What if I choose this path?</li>
      <li>Can I make a difference?</li>
      <li>Can I be like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">These questions have been running through my mind for weeks, until I finally decided to pursue information technology. I passed the entrance exam at the University of Dagupan, but I ended up enrolling at the University of Pangasinan, thanks to my friends' influence.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="the-path" class="container mx-auto my-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Path</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">My journey in technology has not been easy. With so many fields to choose from, I felt a little insecure and had doubts about myself.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li>What if I didn’t excel?</li>
      <li>What if I chose the wrong course?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">These thoughts continued to bother me, but I didn’t let them stop me. I decided to study data structures and algorithms in advance, which helped me choose my career path in web development. I have always been fond of websites, which is why I began my first semester by studying different tools and programming languages. This helped me gain knowledge and confidence in my abilities.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="first-project" class="container mx-auto my-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Let's Talk About My First Project</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">When our instructor announced the final group project, my competitive side kicked in, and I ended up doing it alone. Writing the project documentation made me doubt myself, and thoughts of the upcoming defense scared me. It was tough at first since some groups in my class had already finished their projects. The doubt about my skills lingered, and that's when the reality hit—I was on my own.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I suggested creating my project without groupings, realizing that no one would help me except myself. So, I started working on the project during sleepless nights, balancing it with preparations for our upcoming final exam.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">As the defense day approached, nervousness set in because our panelist was an upperclass instructor. When my turn came, they called me into the cold IT faculty room where I set up my laptop and documents. I bit my tongue, pinched my face, and told myself, 'I can do it.' And then, wow, I successfully defended my project proposal. The panel also praised my skills, saying, 'Your abilities are on par with those of a 3rd-year IT student. Congratulations!'</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Reflecting on that moment now, I realize it was more than just defending a project. It was about defending my dreams, my choices, and my potential. It taught me that even when I’m alone and my confidence is dropping to zero, I should still pursue my goals. As I once read in a Facebook post, ‘It’s you vs. you.’ In other words, I am responsible for my own success and should not let my fears hold me back.</p>
